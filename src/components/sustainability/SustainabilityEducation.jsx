      content: `
        Sustainable gardening is a holistic approach that works with nature to create gardens 
        that not only thrive but also contribute positively to the environment. In Ireland's 
        unique climate and ecosystem, these principles help preserve the country's rich natural 
        heritage while creating productive and beautiful gardens.

    soil: {
      title: "Soil Health",
      content: `
        Healthy soil is the foundation of sustainable gardening. Irish soils vary greatly, from 
        acidic peat soils to alkaline limestone areas. Building soil health through composting, 
        mulching, and avoiding chemical fertilizers supports beneficial soil organisms and 
        improves structure. 
        
        By focusing on soil health, you'll reduce the need for artificial inputs, improve water 
        retention, and grow stronger plants that naturally resist pests and diseases.

        "Use compost and organic matter to improve soil structure",

    water: {
      title: "Water Conservation",
      content: `
        While Ireland is known for its rainfall, climate change is causing more frequent dry spells. 
        Water conservation becomes increasingly important, both for environmental sustainability 
        and practical gardening.
        
        Rainwater harvesting is particularly effective in Ireland - with average rainfall of 
        1000+ mm annually, a typical Irish roof can collect enough water to meet most garden needs.
      `,

      title: "Supporting Biodiversity",
      content: `
        Ireland has experienced a troubling decline in biodiversity, with over one-third of wild 
        bee species threatened with extinction. Gardens can serve as vital sanctuaries for native 
        wildlife if managed with biodiversity in mind.
        
        By creating diverse habitats and focusing on native plants, your garden can help protect 
        Ireland's unique ecosystem while enjoying the benefits of natural pest control and pollination.

      content: `
        Sustainable gardens minimize waste and use resources efficiently. This involves reusing 
        and recycling materials, choosing durable tools and equipment, and planning for longevity.
        
        The concept of circular economy applies perfectly to gardening - where outputs from one 
        process become inputs for another, mimicking natural ecosystems.

        Growing food in your garden is one of the most impactful sustainability practices. 
        It reduces food miles, eliminates packaging waste, and gives you control over how 
        your food is grown.
        
        In Ireland's mild, maritime climate, it's possible to grow food year-round with 
        proper planning and selection of suitable crops.
