      <p class="mb-4">
        Sustainable gardening in Ireland takes advantage of the unique climate and growing 
        conditions while preserving the rich biodiversity and natural resources of the island.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        With abundant rainfall (1000+ mm annually in most regions), water conservation may seem 
        less critical than in other countries, but proper management during increasingly common 
        dry spells is becoming important. Ireland's mild, maritime climate allows year-round 
        growing with proper planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The protection of Ireland's peatlands is a particular sustainability focus, as these 
        environments serve as valuable carbon sinks and unique habitats. Using peat-free gardening 
        methods helps preserve these important ecosystems.
